Rule Examples for Superpolator3
May 4, 2014, version 1

These 6 masters contain 2 glyphs, "a" and "n". Each glyph has a ".wide" alternate shape and a rule that activates in the bolder weights. 

The rule is set up as follows: one condition: weight > 500. Then all glyphs are checked if they have an alternate with the .wide extension. So for instance, "a" will pair with "a.wide".
